### TAKEAWAYS (at ex23)
 - Puts: Prints to the console
 - \: Escapes whatever is next (eg. `\n` goes back in line)

 - + (strings): Concatenation
 - % (interpolation): Formatter for consistency in interpolation of variables
 - """ """: Multiple line string
 - \t: Tab in what is printed to console
 - gets.chomp: Gets next line (can prompt user)
 - $0 (shell): Current document
 - ARGV: Gives argument to entire script
 - $stdin.gets.chomp vs gets.chomp : read user input / read ARGV, if empty read user input

 - open(file): Unpacks a file into a slice of memory
 - open(file).read: Reads file opened above. puts open(file).read will print the file to console
 - open(file).close: Put at end of script to avoid memory leaks
 - open(file, w): Opens file in write mode (r for read, etc...)
 - .write: Writes into file
 - .truncate: Empties file
 - .seek: Goes back to first byte of file (needs to after it being put)
